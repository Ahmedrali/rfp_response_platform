LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:42:18
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
ASSISTANT      # Database configuration
ASSISTANT     -DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/rfp_platform_db
ASSISTANT     +DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost:5432/rfp_platform_db
ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.

ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i get error when i try to run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
ASSISTANT      # Database configuration
ASSISTANT     -DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/rfp_platform_db
ASSISTANT     +DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost:5432/rfp_platform_db
ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/requirements.txt
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:43:08
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT **Important Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Apply the `DATABASE_URL` change to your actual `backend/.env` file.** The `.env.example` is just a template.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.

ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i get error when i try to run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/requirements.txt
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:43:36
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
USER 
USER The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
USER 
USER Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
USER 
USER 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
USER 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
USER 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
USER 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
USER 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
USER 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

USER You MUST use this *file listing* format:
USER 
USER path/to/filename.js
USER ```
USER // entire file content ...
USER // ... goes in between
USER ```
USER 
USER Every *file listing* MUST use this format:
USER - First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
USER - Second line: opening ```
USER - ... entire content of the file ...
USER - Final line: closing ```
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
USER *NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
USER Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.

ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i get error when i try to run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/requirements.txt
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/main.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I missed that the `asyncpg` driver and the `DATABASE_URL` format were not updated in the files you provided in the last message.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:
ASSISTANT 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.
ASSISTANT 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's correct these:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You need to add `asyncpg` to this file.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:** After saving the changes to `backend/requirements.txt`, run the following command in your terminal:

ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     ```bash
ASSISTANT     cd backend && uv run main.py

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the database driver issue. The `main.py` modifications for `lifespan` were good for addressing the deprecation warnings, but this driver issue is fundamental to connecting to your database asynchronously.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:
ASSISTANT 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.
ASSISTANT 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's correct these:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You need to add `asyncpg` to this file.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:54:42
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the necessary modifications:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/.env.example`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:
ASSISTANT 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.
ASSISTANT 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's correct these:
ASSISTANT

USER You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I missed that the `asyncpg` driver and the `DATABASE_URL` format were not updated in the files you provided in the last message.  
USER   
USER The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:  
USER 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.  
USER 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.

USER i have a database connection error when i run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/alembic/env.py, backend/app/utils/database.py, backend/main.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:55:41
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.

ASSISTANT The `sync_url` in your `alembic/env.py` already correctly strips the `?schema=public` part if it exists. Now, we need to ensure that when `create_engine` is called with this `sync_url`, it also sets the schema for the synchronous connection used by Alembic.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT 
-------
USER Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.  
USER   
USER The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.  
USER   
USER Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:  
USER   
USER 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.  
USER 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.  
USER 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.  
USER 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.  
USER 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.  
USER 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:

ASSISTANT Ok, I will use that as the true, current contents of the files.
-------
USER i have a database connection error when i run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the necessary modifications:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/.env.example`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.

USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/alembic/env.py, backend/app/utils/database.py, backend/main.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/.env.example`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.

ASSISTANT **3. Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The `sync_url` in your `alembic/env.py` already correctly strips the `?schema=public` part if it exists. Now, we need to ensure that when `create_engine` is called with this `sync_url`, it also sets the schema for the synchronous connection used by Alembic.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.

USER I added these files to the chat: backend/alembic.ini
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T16:56:25
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The most crucial steps are:
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
ASSISTANT # ... other settings ...
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```diff
ASSISTANT --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py

ASSISTANT  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
USER 
USER The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
USER 
USER The most crucial steps are:
USER 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
USER 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
USER 
USER Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
USER 
USER **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
USER 
USER Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
USER 
USER ```
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
USER # ... other settings ...
USER ```
USER 
USER If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
USER 
USER **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
USER 
USER To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
USER 
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
USER 
USER ```diff
USER --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py
USER +++ b/backend/app/utils/database.py
USER @@ -4,9 +4,12 @@
USER  from app.utils.config import settings
USER  from app.models.base import Base
USER  
USER +# --- Debug: Print the DATABASE_URL to ensure it's correct ---
USER +print(f"DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: '{settings.DATABASE_URL}'")
USER +
USER  async_engine = create_async_engine(
USER      settings.DATABASE_URL,
USER      echo=settings.ECHO_SQL,
USER      pool_pre_ping=True, # Check connections before handing them out
USER -    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used
USER +    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used for asyncpg
USER  )
USER  
USER  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
USER 
USER ```
USER 
USER **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
USER 
USER The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
USER 
USER **Next Steps:**
USER 
USER 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
USER 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
USER 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
USER 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
USER     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
USER     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
USER 
USER Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return the entire content of the updated file.
USER You MUST use this *file listing* format:
USER 
USER path/to/filename.js
USER ```
USER // entire file content ...
USER // ... goes in between
USER ```
USER 
USER Every *file listing* MUST use this format:
USER - First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
USER - Second line: opening ```
USER - ... entire content of the file ...
USER - Final line: closing ```
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
USER *NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
USER Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
USER 
USER The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
USER 
USER The most crucial steps are:
USER 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
USER 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
USER 
USER Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
USER 
USER **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
USER 
USER Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
USER 
USER ```
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
USER # ... other settings ...
USER ```
USER 
USER If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
USER 
USER **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
USER 
USER To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
USER 
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
USER 
USER ```diff
USER --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py
USER +++ b/backend/app/utils/database.py
USER @@ -4,9 +4,12 @@
USER  from app.utils.config import settings
USER  from app.models.base import Base
USER  
USER +# --- Debug: Print the DATABASE_URL to ensure it's correct ---
USER +print(f"DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: '{settings.DATABASE_URL}'")
USER +
USER  async_engine = create_async_engine(
USER      settings.DATABASE_URL,
USER      echo=settings.ECHO_SQL,
USER      pool_pre_ping=True, # Check connections before handing them out
USER -    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used
USER +    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used for asyncpg
USER  )
USER  
USER  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(
USER 
USER ```
USER 
USER **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
USER 
USER The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
USER 
USER **Next Steps:**
USER 
USER 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
USER 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
USER 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
USER 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
USER     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
USER     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
USER 
USER Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I will apply the changes to `backend/app/utils/database.py` to add the debug print statement and ensure the `connect_args` are correctly set for `asyncpg`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
ASSISTANT      # Database configuration

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:
ASSISTANT 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.
ASSISTANT 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's correct these:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT You need to add `asyncpg` to this file.

USER You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I missed that the `asyncpg` driver and the `DATABASE_URL` format were not updated in the files you provided in the last message.  
USER   
USER The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:  
USER 1.  The `asyncpg` driver is missing from your `backend/requirements.txt`.  
USER 2.  The `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env.example` (and likely your actual `backend/.env` file) is still configured for the synchronous `psycopg2` driver.  
USER   
USER Let's correct these:  
USER   
USER **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**

ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/alembic/env.py, backend/app/utils/database.py, backend/main.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.

ASSISTANT **3. Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The `sync_url` in your `alembic/env.py` already correctly strips the `?schema=public` part if it exists. Now, we need to ensure that when `create_engine` is called with this `sync_url`, it also sets the schema for the synchronous connection used by Alembic.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/alembic.ini
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The most crucial steps are:
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
ASSISTANT # ... other settings ...
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```diff

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return the entire content of the updated file.
USER You MUST use this *file listing* format:
USER 
USER path/to/filename.js
USER ```
USER // entire file content ...
USER // ... goes in between
USER ```
USER 
USER Every *file listing* MUST use this format:
USER - First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
USER - Second line: opening ```
USER - ... entire content of the file ...
USER - Final line: closing ```
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
USER *NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
USER Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T17:01:40
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Modify `backend/.env.example`**: Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i have a database connection error when i run the server
-------
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the necessary modifications:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/.env.example`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/.env.example, backend/alembic/env.py, backend/app/utils/database.py, backend/main.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/.env.example`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.

ASSISTANT **3. Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The `sync_url` in your `alembic/env.py` already correctly strips the `?schema=public` part if it exists. Now, we need to ensure that when `create_engine` is called with this `sync_url`, it also sets the schema for the synchronous connection used by Alembic.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/alembic.ini
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The most crucial steps are:
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
ASSISTANT # ... other settings ...
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```diff

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?
-------
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Modify `backend/.env.example`**: Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T17:02:03
ASSISTANT The file `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` you provided appears correct and does not require changes to address the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error. This file correctly consumes `AsyncSessionLocal` from `app/utils/database.py`, which is where the database engine and session-making configurations are centralized.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The fix for the error relies on the changes previously discussed for:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.    **Your actual `backend/.env` file**: The `DATABASE_URL` must be updated to remove the `?schema=public` part. For example, it should be `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`. This is the most critical step.
ASSISTANT 2.    `backend/app/utils/database.py`: This file needs to have `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` added to the `create_async_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 3.    `backend/alembic/env.py`: This file needs to have the appropriate `connect_args` (e.g., `{'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`) added to its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure Alembic also uses the correct schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have applied those changes correctly to the specified files, especially ensuring your active `backend/.env` file (not just `backend/.env.example`) is updated, and then restarted your server, the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error should be resolved.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT At this moment, for *this specific issue*, no other files seem necessary to add to the chat, assuming the previously mentioned files are correctly modified.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT **Important Next Steps:**

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` indicates that the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is not being correctly interpreted by the `asyncpg` driver when SQLAlchemy tries to establish a connection.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove the `?schema=public` query parameter from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for both its asynchronous and synchronous migration paths.
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.

USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/alembic.ini
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The most crucial steps are:
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
ASSISTANT # ... other settings ...
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:

ASSISTANT **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?
-------
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Modify `backend/.env.example`**: Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **After applying these changes:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` updated** (without `?schema=public`).
ASSISTANT 2.  Try running your server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic migrations correctly target the `public` schema.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: backend/app/utils/dependencies.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT The file `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` you provided appears correct and does not require changes to address the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error. This file correctly consumes `AsyncSessionLocal` from `app/utils/database.py`, which is where the database engine and session-making configurations are centralized.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The fix for the error relies on the changes previously discussed for:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.    **Your actual `backend/.env` file**: The `DATABASE_URL` must be updated to remove the `?schema=public` part. For example, it should be `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`. This is the most critical step.
ASSISTANT 2.    `backend/app/utils/database.py`: This file needs to have `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` added to the `create_async_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 3.    `backend/alembic/env.py`: This file needs to have the appropriate `connect_args` (e.g., `{'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`) added to its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure Alembic also uses the correct schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have applied those changes correctly to the specified files, especially ensuring your active `backend/.env` file (not just `backend/.env.example`) is updated, and then restarted your server, the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error should be resolved.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT At this moment, for *this specific issue*, no other files seem necessary to add to the chat, assuming the previously mentioned files are correctly modified.
-------
USER go ahead and implement these fixes then
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return the entire content of the updated file.
USER You MUST use this *file listing* format:
USER 
USER path/to/filename.js
USER ```
USER // entire file content ...
USER // ... goes in between
USER ```
USER 
USER Every *file listing* MUST use this format:
USER - First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
USER - Second line: opening ```
USER - ... entire content of the file ...
USER - Final line: closing ```
USER 
USER To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
USER *NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
USER Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.
USER 
USER 
LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T17:03:46
ASSISTANT Okay, I will implement the fixes.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Remember to **also apply the change in `DATABASE_URL` to your actual `backend/.env` file**, as the `.env.example` file is just a template.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async` indicates that your `DATABASE_URL` is configured for a synchronous driver (like `psycopg2`), but SQLAlchemy's asynchronous engine requires an asynchronous driver (like `asyncpg`).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify your configuration:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensure necessary drivers are in your `requirements.txt`**:
ASSISTANT     Your `backend/requirements.txt` file should include `asyncpg` for asynchronous operations and a synchronous driver like `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) for Alembic's synchronous operations.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If they are missing, add them:
ASSISTANT     ```text
ASSISTANT     # backend/requirements.txt
ASSISTANT     # ... other dependencies
ASSISTANT     asyncpg
ASSISTANT     psycopg2-binary  # or psycopg[binary]
ASSISTANT     # ...
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     Then run `cd backend && uv sync` to install them.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update your database connection URL**:
ASSISTANT     The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely set in a `backend/.env` file) needs to specify the `asyncpg` driver.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Modify `backend/.env.example` to reflect the correct format. Your actual `backend/.env` file should be updated accordingly.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Change to be made in `backend/.env.example`:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     If your `DATABASE_URL` currently looks like:
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT     or
ASSISTANT     `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     Change it to:
ASSISTANT     ```diff
ASSISTANT     --- a/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     +++ b/backend/.env.example
ASSISTANT     @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@

ASSISTANT      
ASSISTANT      # API settings
ASSISTANT      API_V1_STR=/api/v1
ASSISTANT     ```
ASSISTANT     (Adjust `user`, `password`, `localhost`, `5432`, and `rfp_platform_db` to your actual database credentials and name).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     **Action for you**:
ASSISTANT     *   Apply a similar change to your actual `backend/.env` file.
ASSISTANT     *   Ensure `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg[binary]`) are in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, try running the server again. The `alembic/env.py` configuration is already set up to correctly handle a `DATABASE_URL` using `+asyncpg` for its synchronous migration tasks by stripping the `+asyncpg` part.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed the `backend/.env.example` and `backend/requirements.txt` files.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The issue is that your application is configured to use an asynchronous database engine, but the `DATABASE_URL` is set up for a synchronous driver, and the necessary asynchronous driver (`asyncpg`) is missing from your dependencies.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Add `asyncpg` to your requirements.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration to use the `asyncpg` driver.**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Modify `backend/requirements.txt`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add `asyncpg` to the list of dependencies. A common version is `0.29.0`, but you can let `uv` resolve the latest compatible one or pick a specific version if needed.

ASSISTANT 2.  **Install the new dependency:**
ASSISTANT     Run the command `cd backend && uv sync` in your terminal to install `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Try running the server again:**
ASSISTANT     Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes should resolve the `InvalidRequestError` related to the asyncio driver.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I've reviewed `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The previous instructions addressed the primary error (`InvalidRequestError` for the async driver). Now, let's address the `DeprecationWarning` related to `on_event` handlers in your `backend/main.py` file. FastAPI encourages using the `lifespan` argument with an async context manager for startup and shutdown events.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how to modify `backend/main.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Import `asynccontextmanager`**.
ASSISTANT 2.  **Define a `lifespan` async context manager function** that will encapsulate your startup and shutdown logic.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Move the existing startup logic** into the `lifespan` function before the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 4.  **Move the existing shutdown logic** into the `lifespan` function after the `yield` statement.
ASSISTANT 5.  **Remove the old `startup_event` and `shutdown_event` functions** and their `@app.on_event` decorators.
ASSISTANT 6.  **Pass the `lifespan` function to the `FastAPI` constructor**.

ASSISTANT You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I missed that the `asyncpg` driver and the `DATABASE_URL` format were not updated in the files you provided in the last message.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async.` persists because:

ASSISTANT 2.  Explicitly tell SQLAlchemy and `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema via `connect_args` when creating the database engine.

ASSISTANT **Explanation of changes in `alembic/env.py`:**
ASSISTANT *   For `run_async_migrations`: We add `connect_args={'server_settings': {'search_path': 'public'}}` to `create_async_engine`, similar to how it's done in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT *   For `run_migrations_online` (the synchronous path):
ASSISTANT     *   The `db_url` is already modified to be a synchronous URL (e.g., `postgresql://...`).
ASSISTANT     *   We add `connect_args={'options': '-c search_path=public'}` to `create_engine`. This is the way to set the `search_path` for synchronous `psycopg2` connections via SQLAlchemy's `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes to all three files (and your local `backend/.env`), run `cd backend && uv sync` (though no new packages were added, it's good practice if requirements were touched, which they weren't in this step but were previously) and then try running the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`. This should resolve the `unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest versions of `backend/.env.example`, `backend/alembic/env.py`, `backend/app/utils/database.py`, and `backend/main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` arises because the `?schema=public` part of your `DATABASE_URL` is passed directly to the `asyncpg` connection function, which doesn't recognize a `schema` keyword argument in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to:
ASSISTANT 1.  Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment configuration.
ASSISTANT 2.  Instruct SQLAlchemy to set the schema using `connect_args` for the asynchronous engine in `app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Ensure Alembic also correctly uses the `public` schema for its synchronous operations by adding appropriate `connect_args` to its `create_engine` call.

ASSISTANT **3. Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The `sync_url` in your `alembic/env.py` already correctly strips the `?schema=public` part if it exists. Now, we need to ensure that when `create_engine` is called with this `sync_url`, it also sets the schema for the synchronous connection used by Alembic.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We will modify the `run_migrations_online` function. The `run_async_migrations` function in your current `env.py` is actually using a synchronous `create_engine` as well, so it would benefit from the same logic if it were the one being called, but the standard path is `run_migrations_online`.

ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT **Explanation of `alembic/env.py` changes:**
ASSISTANT *   In `run_migrations_online`:
ASSISTANT     *   We define `sync_connect_args = {'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public` for the connection.
ASSISTANT     *   This `sync_connect_args` is passed to `create_engine`.
ASSISTANT *   In `run_async_migrations` (which is currently implemented synchronously):
ASSISTANT     *   A similar `sync_connect_args` is added. It tries to be a bit smarter by attempting to parse the schema from `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")` if present, defaulting to "public". Given we're removing it from `DATABASE_URL`, this will effectively default to `public`. This makes it robust if you ever re-introduce a schema parameter to `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.ini`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After applying these changes:
ASSISTANT 1.  Ensure your `backend/.env` file reflects the `DATABASE_URL` change.
ASSISTANT 2.  Run `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic operate on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The most crucial steps are:
ASSISTANT 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```diff

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Next Steps:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**
ASSISTANT 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.
ASSISTANT 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).
ASSISTANT     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

USER Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).  
USER   
USER The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.  
USER   
USER The most crucial steps are:  
USER 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**  
USER 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.  
USER   
USER Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.  
USER   
USER **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**  
USER   
USER Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:  
USER   
USER ```  
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'  
USER # ... other settings ...  
USER ```  
USER   
USER If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.  
USER   
USER **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**  
USER   
USER To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.  
USER   
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:  
USER   
USER ```diff  
USER --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER +++ b/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER @@ -4,9 +4,12 @@

USER +  
USER  async_engine = create_async_engine(  
USER      settings.DATABASE_URL,  
USER      echo=settings.ECHO_SQL,  
USER      pool_pre_ping=True, # Check connections before handing them out  
USER -    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used  
USER +    connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}} # Ensure public schema is used for asyncpg  
USER  )  
USER    
USER  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(  
USER   
USER ```  
USER   
USER **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**  
USER   
USER The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.  
USER   
USER **Next Steps:**  
USER   
USER 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**  
USER 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.  
USER 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.  
USER 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.  
USER     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).  
USER     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.  
USER   
USER Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I will apply the changes to `backend/app/utils/database.py` to add the debug print statement and ensure the `connect_args` are correctly set for `asyncpg`.

ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I see that `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` has been added to the chat. I will consider its content if any future changes require it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'm ready for your next instruction.
ASSISTANT 
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?  
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Modify `backend/.env.example`**: Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **After applying these changes:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` updated** (without `?schema=public`).
ASSISTANT 2.  Try running your server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic migrations correctly target the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The file `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` you provided appears correct and does not require changes to address the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error. This file correctly consumes `AsyncSessionLocal` from `app/utils/database.py`, which is where the database engine and session-making configurations are centralized.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The fix for the error relies on the changes previously discussed for:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.    **Your actual `backend/.env` file**: The `DATABASE_URL` must be updated to remove the `?schema=public` part. For example, it should be `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`. This is the most critical step.
ASSISTANT 2.    `backend/app/utils/database.py`: This file needs to have `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` added to the `create_async_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 3.    `backend/alembic/env.py`: This file needs to have the appropriate `connect_args` (e.g., `{'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`) added to its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure Alembic also uses the correct schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have applied those changes correctly to the specified files, especially ensuring your active `backend/.env` file (not just `backend/.env.example`) is updated, and then restarted your server, the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error should be resolved.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT At this moment, for *this specific issue*, no other files seem necessary to add to the chat, assuming the previously mentioned files are correctly modified.

USER i have a database connection error when i run the server : Database connection failed on startup. [__main__] error=role "postgres" does not exist
LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T19:07:57
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=role "postgres" does not exist` indicates that the username specified in your `DATABASE_URL` for connecting to your PostgreSQL database is not recognized by the database server.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT In your `backend/.env.example` file (and presumably in your actual `backend/.env` file), the `DATABASE_URL` is:
ASSISTANT `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This URL attempts to connect with:
ASSISTANT *   Username: `postgres`
ASSISTANT *   Password: `postgress`
ASSISTANT *   Host: `localhost`
ASSISTANT *   Port: `5432`
ASSISTANT *   Database name: `rfp_platform`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error "role "postgres" does not exist" means that your PostgreSQL server does not have a user (role) named `postgres`, or if it does, it's not accessible in the way the connection is being attempted.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **To resolve this, you need to:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Verify your PostgreSQL User:**
ASSISTANT     *   Check what users are available in your PostgreSQL database. If you used a different username when setting up PostgreSQL or your specific database `rfp_platform`, you need to use that username.
ASSISTANT     *   The user `postgres` is often a default superuser in PostgreSQL, but it's possible it was named differently, or your database instance doesn't have it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update `backend/.env`:**
ASSISTANT     *   Open your **actual `backend/.env` file** (not the `.env.example`).
ASSISTANT     *   Modify the `DATABASE_URL` to use the correct username and password for your PostgreSQL database.
ASSISTANT         For example, if your username is `myuser` and password is `mypassword`, it would look like:
ASSISTANT         `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 3.  **Ensure the User Has Permissions:**
ASSISTANT     *   The user specified in the `DATABASE_URL` must have the necessary permissions to connect to the `rfp_platform` database and perform operations (like selecting, inserting, updating, and creating tables if Alembic needs to run migrations).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Example of checking/creating a user in PostgreSQL (using `psql`):**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have `psql` access, you can check users with `\du`.
ASSISTANT To create a user and grant permissions (as a superuser like the default `postgres` if it exists, or another admin user):
ASSISTANT ```sql
ASSISTANT -- Connect to psql as an admin user
ASSISTANT CREATE USER mynewuser WITH PASSWORD 'securepassword';
ASSISTANT ALTER USER mynewuser CREATEDB; -- Optional: if this user needs to create databases
ASSISTANT GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rfp_platform TO mynewuser; -- Grant privileges on a specific database
ASSISTANT -- Or, if the database doesn't exist yet and the user should create it:
ASSISTANT -- (No specific grant needed here if the user has CREATEDB and creates it)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT Then, your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` would use `mynewuser` and `securepassword`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Action for you:**
ASSISTANT *   Confirm the correct PostgreSQL username and password for your `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT *   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env` file with these correct credentials.
ASSISTANT *   Ensure this user has the necessary permissions on the `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After updating your `backend/.env` file, try running the server again.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER 
USER 
USER To resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error, follow these steps **in order** to ensure the `DATABASE_URL` is correctly configured and the schema is set via `connect_args`:
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **1. Verify `backend/.env` (Critical Step)**
USER Ensure your **local environment file** (`backend/.env`) uses the corrected `DATABASE_URL` **without** the `?schema=public` parameter. It should look like this:
USER 
USER ```env
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
USER ```
USER 
USER If you only updated `backend/.env.example`, the runtime error will persist because the actual `.env` file is used for execution.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **2. Add a Debug Print in `database.py`**
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` to print the `DATABASE_URL` being used:
USER 
USER ```python
USER from app.utils.config import settings
USER from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, async_sessionmaker
USER 
USER # --- Debug: Print the DATABASE_URL to confirm ---
USER print(f"DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: '{settings.DATABASE_URL}'")
USER 
USER async_engine = create_async_engine(
USER     settings.DATABASE_URL,
USER     echo=settings.ECHO_SQL,
USER     pool_pre_ping=True,
USER     connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}},  # Set schema via asyncpg
USER )
USER ```
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **3. Run the Server and Observe Output**
USER Execute the server with:
USER ```bash
USER cd backend && uv run main.py
USER ```
USER 
USER **Expected Output:**
USER - The debug line should show a `DATABASE_URL` **without** `?schema=public`.
USER - If the URL still includes `?schema=public`, the `.env` file was not updated, or the environment variable is overridden elsewhere.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **4. Check for Overriding Environment Variables**
USER Ensure no other process is overriding the `DATABASE_URL`:
USER - Check shell exports: `echo $DATABASE_URL`
USER - If using Docker, verify `environment` in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` commands.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **5. Final Fixes**
USER If the debug output shows the correct URL but the error persists:
USER 1. **Restart your terminal or IDE** to clear any cached environment variables.
USER 2. If using a virtual environment, reactivate it:
USER    ```bash
USER    source venv/bin/activate
USER    ```
USER 3. If using a `.env` loader (e.g., `python-dotenv`), ensure `.env` is in the correct directory and loaded properly.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **6. Alembic Configuration (Optional)**
USER The `backend/alembic.ini` file is not the issue here. Alembic uses `env.py` to build the connection, and your `env.py` already includes logic to strip schema parameters. No changes are needed here.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **Summary**
USER - âœ… Remove `?schema=public` from `backend/.env`.
USER - âœ… Add the debug print in `database.py`.
USER - âœ… Confirm the debug output shows the corrected URL.
USER - âœ… Restart processes to clear cached variables.
USER 
USER If the issue persists after these steps, share the exact debug output and your `.env` file (with credentials redacted). This will help identify if the problem is elsewhere.
-------
USER Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).  
USER   
USER The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.  
USER   
USER The most crucial steps are:  
USER 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**  
USER 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.  
USER   
USER Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.  
USER   
USER **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**  
USER   
USER Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:  
USER   
USER ```  
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'  
USER # ... other settings ...  
USER ```  
USER   
USER If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.  
USER   
USER **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**  
USER   
USER To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.  
USER   
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:  
USER   
USER ```diff  
USER --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER +++ b/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER @@ -4,9 +4,12 @@

USER      settings.DATABASE_URL,

USER  )  
USER    
USER  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(  
USER   
USER ```  
USER   
USER **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**  
USER   
USER The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.  
USER   
USER **Next Steps:**  
USER   
USER 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**  
USER 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.  
USER 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.  
USER 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.  
USER     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).  
USER     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.  
USER   
USER Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I see that `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` has been added to the chat. I will consider its content if any future changes require it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'm ready for your next instruction.
ASSISTANT 
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?  
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **After applying these changes:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` updated** (without `?schema=public`).
ASSISTANT 2.  Try running your server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic migrations correctly target the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The file `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` you provided appears correct and does not require changes to address the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error. This file correctly consumes `AsyncSessionLocal` from `app/utils/database.py`, which is where the database engine and session-making configurations are centralized.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The fix for the error relies on the changes previously discussed for:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.    **Your actual `backend/.env` file**: The `DATABASE_URL` must be updated to remove the `?schema=public` part. For example, it should be `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`. This is the most critical step.
ASSISTANT 2.    `backend/app/utils/database.py`: This file needs to have `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` added to the `create_async_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 3.    `backend/alembic/env.py`: This file needs to have the appropriate `connect_args` (e.g., `{'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`) added to its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure Alembic also uses the correct schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have applied those changes correctly to the specified files, especially ensuring your active `backend/.env` file (not just `backend/.env.example`) is updated, and then restarted your server, the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error should be resolved.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT At this moment, for *this specific issue*, no other files seem necessary to add to the chat, assuming the previously mentioned files are correctly modified.

ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i have a database connection error when i run the server : Database connection failed on startup. [__main__] error=role "postgres" does not exist
-------
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=role "postgres" does not exist` indicates that the username specified in your `DATABASE_URL` for connecting to your PostgreSQL database is not recognized by the database server.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT In your `backend/.env.example` file (and presumably in your actual `backend/.env` file), the `DATABASE_URL` is:
ASSISTANT `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This URL attempts to connect with:
ASSISTANT *   Username: `postgres`
ASSISTANT *   Password: `postgress`
ASSISTANT *   Host: `localhost`
ASSISTANT *   Port: `5432`
ASSISTANT *   Database name: `rfp_platform`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error "role "postgres" does not exist" means that your PostgreSQL server does not have a user (role) named `postgres`, or if it does, it's not accessible in the way the connection is being attempted.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **To resolve this, you need to:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Verify your PostgreSQL User:**
ASSISTANT     *   Check what users are available in your PostgreSQL database. If you used a different username when setting up PostgreSQL or your specific database `rfp_platform`, you need to use that username.
ASSISTANT     *   The user `postgres` is often a default superuser in PostgreSQL, but it's possible it was named differently, or your database instance doesn't have it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update `backend/.env`:**
ASSISTANT     *   Open your **actual `backend/.env` file** (not the `.env.example`).
ASSISTANT     *   Modify the `DATABASE_URL` to use the correct username and password for your PostgreSQL database.
ASSISTANT         For example, if your username is `myuser` and password is `mypassword`, it would look like:
ASSISTANT         `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 3.  **Ensure the User Has Permissions:**
ASSISTANT     *   The user specified in the `DATABASE_URL` must have the necessary permissions to connect to the `rfp_platform` database and perform operations (like selecting, inserting, updating, and creating tables if Alembic needs to run migrations).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Example of checking/creating a user in PostgreSQL (using `psql`):**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have `psql` access, you can check users with `\du`.
ASSISTANT To create a user and grant permissions (as a superuser like the default `postgres` if it exists, or another admin user):
ASSISTANT ```sql
ASSISTANT -- Connect to psql as an admin user
ASSISTANT CREATE USER mynewuser WITH PASSWORD 'securepassword';
ASSISTANT ALTER USER mynewuser CREATEDB; -- Optional: if this user needs to create databases
ASSISTANT GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rfp_platform TO mynewuser; -- Grant privileges on a specific database
ASSISTANT -- Or, if the database doesn't exist yet and the user should create it:
ASSISTANT -- (No specific grant needed here if the user has CREATEDB and creates it)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT Then, your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` would use `mynewuser` and `securepassword`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Action for you:**
ASSISTANT *   Confirm the correct PostgreSQL username and password for your `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT *   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env` file with these correct credentials.
ASSISTANT *   Ensure this user has the necessary permissions on the `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After updating your `backend/.env` file, try running the server again.
-------
USER update the postgress user name, here is how i created the database : CREATE DATABASE rfp_platform;
USER CREATE USER rfp_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
USER GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rfp_platform TO rfp_user;

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T19:10:49
ASSISTANT Okay, I understand. You've created a new PostgreSQL user `rfp_user` with the password `'your_secure_password'` and granted it all privileges on the `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to update the `DATABASE_URL` to use these new credentials. I will update the `backend/.env.example` file.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Important:** You will also need to make this same change in your actual `backend/.env` file, replacing `'your_secure_password'` with the actual secure password you set for the `rfp_user`. The `.env.example` file is a template and is often committed to version control, so it should not contain real sensitive passwords.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER I spoke to you previously about a number of things.
USER 
USER 
USER To resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error, follow these steps **in order** to ensure the `DATABASE_URL` is correctly configured and the schema is set via `connect_args`:
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **1. Verify `backend/.env` (Critical Step)**
USER Ensure your **local environment file** (`backend/.env`) uses the corrected `DATABASE_URL` **without** the `?schema=public` parameter. It should look like this:
USER 
USER ```env
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'
USER ```
USER 
USER If you only updated `backend/.env.example`, the runtime error will persist because the actual `.env` file is used for execution.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **2. Add a Debug Print in `database.py`**
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` to print the `DATABASE_URL` being used:
USER 
USER ```python
USER from app.utils.config import settings
USER from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, async_sessionmaker
USER 
USER # --- Debug: Print the DATABASE_URL to confirm ---
USER print(f"DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: '{settings.DATABASE_URL}'")
USER 
USER async_engine = create_async_engine(
USER     settings.DATABASE_URL,
USER     echo=settings.ECHO_SQL,
USER     pool_pre_ping=True,
USER     connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}},  # Set schema via asyncpg
USER )
USER ```
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **3. Run the Server and Observe Output**
USER Execute the server with:
USER ```bash
USER cd backend && uv run main.py
USER ```
USER 
USER **Expected Output:**
USER - The debug line should show a `DATABASE_URL` **without** `?schema=public`.
USER - If the URL still includes `?schema=public`, the `.env` file was not updated, or the environment variable is overridden elsewhere.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **4. Check for Overriding Environment Variables**
USER Ensure no other process is overriding the `DATABASE_URL`:
USER - Check shell exports: `echo $DATABASE_URL`
USER - If using Docker, verify `environment` in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` commands.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **5. Final Fixes**
USER If the debug output shows the correct URL but the error persists:
USER 1. **Restart your terminal or IDE** to clear any cached environment variables.
USER 2. If using a virtual environment, reactivate it:
USER    ```bash
USER    source venv/bin/activate
USER    ```
USER 3. If using a `.env` loader (e.g., `python-dotenv`), ensure `.env` is in the correct directory and loaded properly.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **6. Alembic Configuration (Optional)**
USER The `backend/alembic.ini` file is not the issue here. Alembic uses `env.py` to build the connection, and your `env.py` already includes logic to strip schema parameters. No changes are needed here.
USER 
USER ---
USER 
USER ### **Summary**
USER - âœ… Remove `?schema=public` from `backend/.env`.
USER - âœ… Add the debug print in `database.py`.
USER - âœ… Confirm the debug output shows the corrected URL.
USER - âœ… Restart processes to clear cached variables.
USER 
USER If the issue persists after these steps, share the exact debug output and your `.env` file (with credentials redacted). This will help identify if the problem is elsewhere.
-------
USER Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/alembic.ini`. This file is primarily for configuring Alembic's behavior and usually doesn't directly influence the runtime database connection URL of your FastAPI application, as that's typically handled by your `app.utils.config.settings` loading from environment variables (like your `.env` file).  
USER   
USER The error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` persists because the `DATABASE_URL` that `create_async_engine` in `app/utils/database.py` is receiving *still* includes the `?schema=public` part. The `asyncpg` driver's `connect` method doesn't understand a `schema` keyword argument passed in that way.  
USER   
USER The most crucial steps are:  
USER 1.  **Ensuring your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` without `?schema=public`.**  
USER 2.  Using `connect_args` in `create_async_engine` to correctly tell `asyncpg` to use the `public` schema.  
USER   
USER Let's re-verify and add a debugging step to be certain about the URL being used.  
USER   
USER **1. Critical: Verify `backend/.env` (Your Local Environment File)**  
USER   
USER Please double-check your **`backend/.env`** file (not `backend/.env.example`). It **must** have the `DATABASE_URL` without the `?schema=public` part. It should look like this:  
USER   
USER ```  
USER DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'  
USER # ... other settings ...  
USER ```  
USER   
USER If you made the change only in `backend/.env.example`, it won't affect the running application.  
USER   
USER **2. Add a Debug Print in `backend/app/utils/database.py`**  
USER   
USER To be absolutely sure what `DATABASE_URL` is being used when the engine is created, let's add a print statement. This will show us the exact URL string.  
USER   
USER Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py` as follows:  
USER   
USER ```diff  
USER --- a/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER +++ b/backend/app/utils/database.py  
USER @@ -4,9 +4,12 @@

USER      settings.DATABASE_URL,

USER  )  
USER    
USER  AsyncSessionLocal = async_sessionmaker(  
USER   
USER ```  
USER   
USER **3. Regarding `backend/alembic/env.py` and `backend/alembic.ini`**  
USER   
USER The changes previously suggested for `backend/alembic/env.py` (using `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` for the synchronous engine) are correct for ensuring Alembic operations also target the `public` schema. The `backend/alembic.ini` file you provided doesn't set `sqlalchemy.url`, which is fine, as `env.py` correctly falls back to using `settings.DATABASE_URL` and processes it. These files are unlikely to be the cause of the *runtime startup error* in `main.py`.  
USER   
USER **Next Steps:**  
USER   
USER 1.  **Crucially, ensure `backend/.env` has the corrected `DATABASE_URL`.**  
USER 2.  Apply the debug print change to `backend/app/utils/database.py`.  
USER 3.  Run the server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.  
USER 4.  Observe the output. You should see a line starting with `DEBUG: DATABASE_URL from settings: ...`.  
USER     *   **If this URL still contains `?schema=public`**, it means your `.env` file change didn't take effect, or the environment variable is being overridden from somewhere else (e.g., shell environment).  
USER     *   **If this URL *does not* contain `?schema=public`** and the error persists, then the issue might be more subtle, but this is the most likely culprit.  
USER   
USER Please report back the output of the debug print statement and whether the error continues. This will give us a clear indication of where the problem lies.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I will apply the changes to `backend/app/utils/database.py` to add the debug print statement and ensure the `connect_args` are correctly set for `asyncpg`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Okay, I see that `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` has been added to the chat. I will consider its content if any future changes require it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT I'm ready for your next instruction.
ASSISTANT 
-------
USER should the error be fixed now?  
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT No, the error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` is likely **not fixed** with the files you've just provided.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Looking at the content of the files:
ASSISTANT 1.  `backend/.env.example` still has `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform?schema=public'`. The `?schema=public` part is still there.
ASSISTANT 2.  `backend/app/utils/database.py` is still missing the `connect_args` in the `create_async_engine` call to correctly specify the schema for `asyncpg`.
ASSISTANT 3.  `backend/alembic/env.py` is also missing the necessary `connect_args` for its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure it operates on the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To fix this, we need to make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Modify `backend/.env.example`**: Remove `?schema=public` from the `DATABASE_URL`.
ASSISTANT     *   **Crucially, you must also make this change in your actual `backend/.env` file for it to take effect when you run the server.**
ASSISTANT 2.  **Modify `backend/app/utils/database.py`**: Add `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` to the `create_async_engine` call. This tells `asyncpg` (via SQLAlchemy) to use the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 3.  **Modify `backend/alembic/env.py`**: Add `connect_args={'options': '-csearch_path=public'}` to the synchronous `create_engine` calls. This tells `psycopg2` (the synchronous driver Alembic will use) to set the `search_path` to `public`.

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **After applying these changes:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Crucially, ensure your actual `backend/.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` updated** (without `?schema=public`).
ASSISTANT 2.  Try running your server again: `cd backend && uv run main.py`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This should resolve the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error and ensure both your application and Alembic migrations correctly target the `public` schema.
ASSISTANT 
-------
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The file `backend/app/utils/dependencies.py` you provided appears correct and does not require changes to address the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error. This file correctly consumes `AsyncSessionLocal` from `app/utils/database.py`, which is where the database engine and session-making configurations are centralized.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The fix for the error relies on the changes previously discussed for:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.    **Your actual `backend/.env` file**: The `DATABASE_URL` must be updated to remove the `?schema=public` part. For example, it should be `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`. This is the most critical step.
ASSISTANT 2.    `backend/app/utils/database.py`: This file needs to have `connect_args={"server_settings": {"search_path": "public"}}` added to the `create_async_engine` call.
ASSISTANT 3.    `backend/alembic/env.py`: This file needs to have the appropriate `connect_args` (e.g., `{'options': '-csearch_path=public'}`) added to its synchronous `create_engine` calls to ensure Alembic also uses the correct schema.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have applied those changes correctly to the specified files, especially ensuring your active `backend/.env` file (not just `backend/.env.example`) is updated, and then restarted your server, the `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'schema'` error should be resolved.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT At this moment, for *this specific issue*, no other files seem necessary to add to the chat, assuming the previously mentioned files are correctly modified.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER i have a database connection error when i run the server : Database connection failed on startup. [__main__] error=role "postgres" does not exist
-------
ASSISTANT The error `Database connection failed on startup. error=role "postgres" does not exist` indicates that the username specified in your `DATABASE_URL` for connecting to your PostgreSQL database is not recognized by the database server.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT In your `backend/.env.example` file (and presumably in your actual `backend/.env` file), the `DATABASE_URL` is:
ASSISTANT `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgress@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This URL attempts to connect with:
ASSISTANT *   Username: `postgres`
ASSISTANT *   Password: `postgress`
ASSISTANT *   Host: `localhost`
ASSISTANT *   Port: `5432`
ASSISTANT *   Database name: `rfp_platform`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The error "role "postgres" does not exist" means that your PostgreSQL server does not have a user (role) named `postgres`, or if it does, it's not accessible in the way the connection is being attempted.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **To resolve this, you need to:**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1.  **Verify your PostgreSQL User:**
ASSISTANT     *   Check what users are available in your PostgreSQL database. If you used a different username when setting up PostgreSQL or your specific database `rfp_platform`, you need to use that username.
ASSISTANT     *   The user `postgres` is often a default superuser in PostgreSQL, but it's possible it was named differently, or your database instance doesn't have it.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2.  **Update `backend/.env`:**
ASSISTANT     *   Open your **actual `backend/.env` file** (not the `.env.example`).
ASSISTANT     *   Modify the `DATABASE_URL` to use the correct username and password for your PostgreSQL database.
ASSISTANT         For example, if your username is `myuser` and password is `mypassword`, it would look like:
ASSISTANT         `DATABASE_URL='postgresql+asyncpg://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/rfp_platform'`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 3.  **Ensure the User Has Permissions:**
ASSISTANT     *   The user specified in the `DATABASE_URL` must have the necessary permissions to connect to the `rfp_platform` database and perform operations (like selecting, inserting, updating, and creating tables if Alembic needs to run migrations).
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Example of checking/creating a user in PostgreSQL (using `psql`):**
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT If you have `psql` access, you can check users with `\du`.
ASSISTANT To create a user and grant permissions (as a superuser like the default `postgres` if it exists, or another admin user):
ASSISTANT ```sql
ASSISTANT -- Connect to psql as an admin user
ASSISTANT CREATE USER mynewuser WITH PASSWORD 'securepassword';
ASSISTANT ALTER USER mynewuser CREATEDB; -- Optional: if this user needs to create databases
ASSISTANT GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rfp_platform TO mynewuser; -- Grant privileges on a specific database
ASSISTANT -- Or, if the database doesn't exist yet and the user should create it:
ASSISTANT -- (No specific grant needed here if the user has CREATEDB and creates it)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT Then, your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` would use `mynewuser` and `securepassword`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Action for you:**
ASSISTANT *   Confirm the correct PostgreSQL username and password for your `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT *   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `backend/.env` file with these correct credentials.
ASSISTANT *   Ensure this user has the necessary permissions on the `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After updating your `backend/.env` file, try running the server again.
-------
USER update the postgress user name, here is how i created the database : CREATE DATABASE rfp_platform;
USER CREATE USER rfp_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
USER GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rfp_platform TO rfp_user;
-------
ASSISTANT Okay, I understand. You've created a new PostgreSQL user `rfp_user` with the password `'your_secure_password'` and granted it all privileges on the `rfp_platform` database.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We need to update the `DATABASE_URL` to use these new credentials. I will update the `backend/.env.example` file.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Important:** You will also need to make this same change in your actual `backend/.env` file, replacing `'your_secure_password'` with the actual secure password you set for the `rfp_user`. The `.env.example` file is a template and is often committed to version control, so it should not contain real sensitive passwords.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-05-24T19:11:02
ASSISTANT Okay, I have the latest version of `backend/.env.example`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Based on your previous instructions to update the PostgreSQL username and password using the details from your `CREATE USER` command (`CREATE USER rfp_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';`), I will now update the `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env.example`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The change involves modifying the `DATABASE_URL` to use `rfp_user` as the username and `your_secure_password` as the placeholder for the password.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT **Important Reminder:** You will need to make the corresponding change in your actual `backend/.env` file, replacing `'your_secure_password'` with the actual password you set for the `rfp_user`. The `.env.example` file is a template and should not contain real sensitive passwords.
